Title: Basic ATM Simulator
Project Description:
This Python-based project simulates a basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. 
It allows users to perform essential banking operations such as withdrawing, depositing, checking balance, and changing passwords. 
The system maintains user accounts with unique usernames, pins, and balances. 
It incorporates basic security measures like password verification and transaction limits.

Key Features:

User authentication with username and PIN
Basic ATM functionalities: withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, password change
Simple error handling for incorrect PIN or insufficient balance
Basic user management with a fixed list of users
Limitations:

Does not implement advanced security features like encryption or fraud detection.
Lacks features like transaction history, mini-statements, or account transfers.
Uses static data for users, pins, and balances.
This project serves as a foundational example of ATM system development and can be expanded upon to include more complex functionalities and security measures.
